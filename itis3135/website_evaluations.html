        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my Website Evaluations Page! Here you will see two websites evaluated based of the CRAP Principles.</p>
    
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.nike.com" target="_blank">Nike</a></h3>
            <p>Nike's website showcases their sports apparel and equipment with a sleek, modern design focused on user experience and ease of shopping.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: High contrast between text and backgrounds.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Consistent use of branding elements like fonts and colors.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Content is organized in a clean, grid-based layout.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Related elements are grouped together, simplifying user decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Nike employs CRAP principles effectively to provide an engaging user interface.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="http://www.lingscars.com" target="_blank">LingsCars</a></h3>
            <p>LingsCars offers car leasing and rental services through a chaotic and visually overwhelming website design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Very poor, with text blending into odd backgrounds.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Lacks consistency in fonts, colors, and styles.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Random placement of elements.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Fails to group related content logically, making naviagtion complicated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>LingsCars does not adhere to CRAP principles, resulting in a confusing user interface.</p>
