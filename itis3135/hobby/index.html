            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>My father is what got me started in soccer. He was a professional player for USA, so there was a lot of expectation for me. Both my sisters went onto become accoplished athletes, with one playing college soccer, and the other winning a marathon at a very young age. I've played Varisty HS, club, ODP, College, and Semi-Professional Soccer. </p>

            <h2>Soccer Schedule</h2>
            <p>The best times to watch and play soccer can vary depending on personal preferences and local climate conditions. Generally, soccer matches are popular during the late spring, summer, and early fall when the weather is conducive to playing and watching outdoor sports. In Europe, the soccer season typically runs from August to May with peak viewing times on weekends and weekday evenings to accommodate work schedules. For playing soccer, mornings or late afternoons are ideal as they avoid the peak sun hours, reducing the risk of overheating and dehydration. For spectators, prime times are usually during major tournaments like the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, and national league games, where matches are often scheduled on weekends or midweek evenings. In regions with harsh winters, indoor leagues offer an alternative, with games played throughout the year. Watching soccer also peaks during these tournaments, with fans tuning in from all over the world at various times depending on their time zone.</p>
